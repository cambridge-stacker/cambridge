Cambridge
=========

Welcome to Cambridge, the next open-source falling-block game engine!

The project is written and maintained by [joezeng](https://github.com/joezeng), [Milla](https://github.com/MillaBasset), [Oshisaure](https://github.com/oshisaure), [Tetro48](https://github.com/Tetro48), and a team of contributors at the [Cambridge Discord][discord]!

You can join the project's [Discord server][discord]!

Playing the game
----------------

### Windows

You do not need LÖVE on Windows, as it comes bundled with the program.

#### Stable release

To get the stable release, simply download either `cambridge_windows_x86.zip` (32-bit, x86) or `cambridge_windows_x64.zip` (64-bit, x86-64) in the [latest release](https://github.com/cambridge-stacker/cambridge/releases/latest).

All assets needed are bundled with the executable.

#### Bleeding edge

If you want the bleeding edge version, download [this](https://github.com/cambridge-stacker/cambridge/archive/main.zip). Extract the ZIP to a folder of your choosing.

If you're on Windows, you can double-click `start.bat` to run the game. If that doesn't work, open a Command Prompt where you extracted Cambridge and run:

	dist\windows\love.exe .

If that doesn't work, run this instead, still using Command Prompt where you extracted Cambridge:

	dist\win32\love.exe .

Then, check the mod pack section at the bottom of this page.

### macOS, Linux

If you haven't already, install `love` with your favourite package manager (Homebrew on macOS, your system's default on Linux). **Make sure you're not using LÖVE 11.4, because it's been proven to randomly freeze Cambridge!**

#### Downloading a release

You can download the .love file in the latest release, and run it with:

    love cambridge.love

#### Installing from source

Clone the repository in git:

	git clone https://github.com/cambridge-stacker/cambridge

Alternatively, download the source code ZIP in the latest release.

Then, navigate to the root directory that you just cloned, and type:

	love .

It should run automatically!
